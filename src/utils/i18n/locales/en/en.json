      "The House-Tree-Person (Buck, 1948) is a projective test developed by John Buck (1948) and Emanuel Hammer (1958). The test is extensively used in different contexts to assess personality related issues. The test is very useful in clinical settings because it takes very little time to complete (5 to 10 minutes) and is easy to administer to a wide range of patients across all age spans (age 3 onwards). It is found to be especially helpful with shy, inhibited or nonverbal children who have difficulty expressing their internal worlds via verbal means.",
      "However, to date, there is not a pragmatic assessment protocol accepted by the entire research community to evaluate the HTP test. That is, while is generally accepted the idea that a selection of emotional indicators extracted from the pictures could differentiate patients with or without emotional problems, research in the psychological field is still inconclusive regarding the best set of indicators, which better correlates to emotional difficulties. This work focuses on emotional markers in HTP drawings for depressive, aggressive, or/and anxious problems of children and proposes an interdisciplinary approach to tackle this issue.",
      "This Website is supported by a Tubitak 3005 project, which aims to use Computer Vision (CV), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and Large Language Models (LLM) techniques to automatically extract the critical emotional indicators from the HTP drawings. Subsequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods will search for the most discriminant combination of those emotional traits.",
      "The final aim of the project is to develop a tool to detect the best combination of emotional indicators in the drawings to support the overall diagnostic assessments. That is, the aim is not to make definitive diagnoses based on the drawings but to alert clinicians to certain patterns of emotional indicators that would warrant further assessment and testing.",
      "More in detail, this project focuses on school-age children who have presented with internalizing (e.g., anxiety and depression) and externalizing (e.g., aggression) problems, and it attempts to determine the associations between drawing features and problem types, i.e. to find out the best combination of drawing features to assess the patient’s emotional problems nonverbally.",
      "Overall, this project belongs to the intersection area between psychology and computer engineering.",
      "A deeper introduction to the HTP test together with a demo is at the next page."
