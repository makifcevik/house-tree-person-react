# HOUSE TREE PERSON (HTP) – Frontend

This is the frontend application for the **House-Tree-Person (HTP)**, developed as part of an interdisciplinary TÜBİTAK 3005 project. The platform is powered by articial intelligence (AI) in reviewing, managing, and analyzing children's HTP drawings to help extract emotional indicators such as anxiety, depression, and aggression, contributing to clinical assessments.

## ✨ Features

- ⚛️ Built with **React** and **TypeScript**
- 🎨 Styled using **Tailwind CSS** and **Shadcn UI (Radix UI)**
- 🌐 **Multilingual support** with `i18next` (currently English & Turkish)
- 🔐 **Role-based authentication** via JWT
- 📦 **Efficient data fetching and caching** with `React Query (TanStack Query)`
- 📥 Form handling with **React Hook Form** and validation via **Zod**
- ⚡ Lazy loading for optimal performance
- 🔗 Integrated with backend APIs for user management and drawing data
- 🤝 Collaborative development with AI researchers for model integration

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Project Context
This project is part of an interdisciplinary AI research initiative under the TÜBİTAK 3005 program.
